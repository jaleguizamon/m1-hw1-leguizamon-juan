#Issues
The only issue I encountered was with the content-test branch. I was able to merge it successfully but when looking on GitHub I wasn't able to find trace of the branch. I believe the issue was because we merged the changes to the master branch and committed from the master branch so therefore, remotely, there was no trace of the content-test branch but I did get a bit stuck trying to find trace of it remotely.
